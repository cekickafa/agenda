**Pending Payments**

cekic: Hi Ckeci, `grin1cv82e8mse4kzl8wdrmqdsy8atmnavtj2656s9c0kjpapch7neu5sv7msz4` 👋

wiesche: Did you receive your money?

defistaker: Yes, thanks a lot 🙏

wiesche: We are grateful that you brought patience with you.

anonymous : 😅Yaaa, quite a wait.

defistaker: It is expected since a new Council has been formed, I think it would be more streamlined from now on.

wayne: Pending payments is virtually complete. Just one pending

**Grincoin.org Grant**

ardocrat: Why donation to grincoin.org is pending? @aglkm can just share address and everybody can donate

cekic: There happened a proposal for raising grant to 2000-2500 $ for Grincoin.org
 👍 Anonymous

ardocrat: So its funding request

anonymous: Not exactly, it is/was a donation request. In the CC it was quite hard at the end to pass things, to few active members etc. So I proposed a low amount just to be able to pass it through the council. Now we have new council, and we all agree it should be raised to something like 200-2500.
We want to get feedback if the community also thinks this is justified. We think it is since grincoin.org is quite important, provides both mainet and a testnet explorer and has actively maintained and added functionality. If you agree with raising the bounty, thumbs up this message
👍 cryptospor, lepooh, cekci, wiesche, huell, wayneg, defistaker, anonymous

anonymous: @ardocrat donation request basically means no strings attached, no requirements. So based on past work you can ask for a support bounty, this will not in any way force or require you to make additional work.

cekic: it seems there is agreement. Specify the amount publicly and lets draft the payment asap.

anonymous: Lets do so, lets give @aglkm some love 💛 for 2500$
👍 ardo, wayne, cekic, quietzulu, wiesche, anonymous

anonymous: All CC members have also before unanimously vote in favor of increasing the bounty, so that's a wrap. Next we will draft the transaction to @aglkm. Ok, done

**Telegram Bot Bounty**

cekic: The other bounty payment for TG BOT, any objections for payment ? @wiesche will keep improving the bot.

wayne: I support the payment for TG BOT
👍 lepooh, huell, ckeci, defistaker, anonymous

anonymous: Same here

defistaker: i support also.

cekic: I also support i think it is done 👍

anonymous: From the GGC members we have 3/4 needed 👍for Telegram bot, we will collect more vote in favor then draft the transaction.

cekic:  _@anonymous
ok, to publicly that. @aglkm and upvoted. So 4 votes, we can finalize it i suppose. That 2 drafts (telegram bounty and grincoin.org grant ) will be opened for signing and after that we refund the coldcard payments.

**Umbrel Bounty Idea**

cekic: Ok. next topic. Umbrel Bounty idea

wiesche: https://forum.grin.mw/t/funding-request-grin-node-meets-umbrelos-embassyos/11928

anonymous: I support the creation of a bounty for an Umbrel App/node. I got to go now unfortunately, till next time 👋

wayne: I support this. We’d still need to finalise the funding amount though

wiesche: @wayne What do you say to 5k usd

wayne: @wiesche From the detail I’ve seen in the proposal I’d be happy with this (5k)

anonymous: 5k is fine by me, a higher amount like 7.5k would also be fine by me. I would propose to be more on the generous side for the Ubrel bounty, we can continue that discussion on the forum.
👍 wiesche, cekic

**Developer Contributions & Site Maintenance**

ardocrat: Website cert issue is self-signed thing, when cert is getting update browser compares it with old one and can get error

cekic: @transatoshi_grinminerdotnet transatoshi was handling, but it appears that there is no longer a problem. Still anyone get error ?

wiesche: @CEKİC grin.mw site It's working for me, and I haven't noticed anything like that.

ardocrat: Is there a person responsible for releases? Maybe public one like Linus.@mammothine was ready to help
👍 mammothine

cole: as a rust dev, I can support. i am ready to help @ardocrat. please let me know what I should work on
 👍ardo, cole, wiesche, ckeci

ardocrat: Thats nice, I am finishing to bring back gri.mw then move to vacation till September
👍 wayne, cekic, wiesche

wiesche: @cole We have some open issues (node and wallet)

@colasouda https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/issues
It would be great if you could familiarize yourself with the job

 👍cole

wiesche: How's it going with the database?
ardocrat: Interrupted cause infrastructure, will come back after gri.mw recovery. #1 priority

👍 wiesche, cekic

wiesche: Thanks for your update. and I wish you a relaxing vacation

**General Topics & Concerns**

cekic:@ardocrat are you planning to ask for support grant for GRIM wallet?

ardocrat: No... Telegram bot I support, cause it will help adoption and opens doors for p2p exchange like Ton did
👍 wiesche, cekic

ardocrat: But its /telegram bot also centralized solution as I understood, server can go down..

wiesche: Yes, that's currently the case.

wiesche: Has anyone heard anything about this (tradeogre.com)

cekic: no,it is down

grinmaximus: not great

ardocrat: Problem of any centralized exchange, regulators are not dreaming. Multisig is waiting

wiesche: Multisig is needed

cekic: @vlad_gelfer
👍ardo, wiesche

ardocrat: Document is needed, RFC
👍 wieshce, cekic

wiesche: But then we'll have covered all the points. Good night, everyone.

**TO DO List**

*   Draft the transaction for the $2,500 grant to `@aglkm` for `grincoin.org`, Telegram Bot bounty payment to `@wiesche` for GGC member signing.
*   Refund the coldcard payments after the grant and bounty are processed.
*   Continue the discussion on the forum to finalize the funding amount for the Umbrel bounty.
*  `@cole` to review open issues on the Grin GitHub and coordinate on tasks.

🔨 👋🏽
