I am quite happy how this bounty worked out. There is certainly no guarantee it will work out each time as hoped for, but as far as I can judge, this bounty delivered on its promises and will make a great contribution to Grin as a project. 🚀
+cekic, scilio

__cekic__: Yes, it was an good example. Glad really.

__any__: Based on what I heard from @scilio, incorporating test and making the code well documented, maintable and ready for integration involved quite a bit more work than he anticipated. Luckily he did not complain, but simply put in the effort to make this a success 💪 💛 .
We can take these lessons with us to be more specific in specifying such requirements in any future bounties, although of course we keep hoping to we can entice more devs to become commit contributors to the project since it works better than bounties.

## Testnet and Community Resources

__any__: I think that is all for the official agenda today, we can futher discuss whatever we want over ☕ 🍵
I hope Testnet will be mined soon again. I started an additional node for it, but the problem appears to be no new blocks being mined.

__cekic__: Pinged yesterday but no response at forum.

__any__: I also asked John Davies, but as I red the forum post, it appears only one of the two tesnet miners is using his pool at the moment.
Also great that bruges added an tesnet explorer, that makes it quite a bit easier to keep an eye on whether Testnet is running properly. Also nice for testing various transactions:

## Grin Crypto Understanding

__any__: For myself I have been slightly less focussed on governance lately. Hence I wrote some documentations to help my own understanding of Grin. I am now diving down the rabbit hole of bullet-proofs. It is quite cool but without doubt the single most complex part of Grin to understand. Perhaps one day I can try to write a high level description of it, but for now I am still developing my own understanding of it.
Still it is good to also focus a bit more at the crypto lately, it helps remind me why we are putting in all the effort for Grin, which is because it is really awesome crypto.

__cekic__: Be fair man, you are active really:)

__any__: I try to be, but still my hobby time is limited 😜 Thanks all for joining todays discussion. I have to go now unfortunately.
I will start drafting the transaction today, or do you want to do that @cekickafa? Note that the request is in pounds.

__cekic__: I can send you to check.

__any__: Thanks, saves me some time

__cekic__: Thnx for leading.

## *TO DO List*

*   @any: Draft the transaction for MWixnet Milestone 3 funding.
*   @cekic: Send the transaction draft to @anynomous.
*  Community: Address and restart testnet mining.


**Meeting adjourned.**
