## Personal Project Update and Hash Rate Fluctuation

__any__: There is no agenda for today so I will just update. I am working on a little grin project, but it is too early to share details.
One interesting observation I want to share is the huge fluctuation in hash graph rate for grin.
Each day it fluctuates between 5 kGraphs and 8kGraphs. That is why if you look at the yearly graph rate it looks very low sometimes and normal the other times. Since the last point in the graph is the rate they measure right now, not accounting for these fluctuations.
Apart from that I have nothing to share

## Mining Pool Identification and Centralization

__wayne__: Is there anyway of knowing anything about miners such as pool or location? Like how Bitcoin has a way for miners to ID themselves

__cekic__: Pools are mostly china.
Gaea, alwaysvip,easygrib

__any__: There was the nice circle graph of percentages of each pool, but I cannot find the source.

__cekic__: It is our fault as community, grinmint lagged behind all. It should have  be first or second pool. Idk why miners dont choose it. This is another topic.

__wayne__: That's cool, thanks. I'll add that to my long list of grin bookmarks

__any__: Well, although I prefer it to be less centralized, it probably is not a big deal. Those miners have a large incentive to to produce false blocks.

## Community Engagement and Market Trends

__cekic__: ok any more topic you want to discuss?

__wayne__: I try to keep up with forum convos. Seems like Grim is being played with.
I used to spend time on telegram but there was a lot of spam. I did like the top-of-the-head style though

__wayne__: I think grin is fine though. Things seem slow but I feel all of crypto is experiencing that
I expect that the meme coin craze will die at some point and people will start focusing on real crypto again.

## *TO DO List*

*   Community: Track the ongoing fluctuations of Grin's hash graph rate.


**Meeting adjourned.**
