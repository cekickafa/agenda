# Agenda Points & Actions

* Update and approval of donation to grincoin.org
* Discuss alternatives to Keybase.

## Donation to Grincoin.org

__anonymous__: For todays agenda, we only have single topic to discuss:
[https://github.com/grincc/agenda/issues/153](https://github.com/grincc/agenda/issues/153)
Basically an update on the donation to grincoin.org.
The reasoning behind the donation is that we pay (4*12*$10)=480$ for basic server costs + a motivational bonus of $420 to work on adding a database. That is total of 900$ to be paid in in BTC using a 1 month average. This is donation, not a payment, comes with no strings or requirements. It is a simple thank you and does not in any way aims to compensate the work done in full, for that it is a way to modest amount.

I think that is all we need to discuss for today. Or are there more things to discuss @cekickafa?

__cekickafa__: Nothing at the moment. CC members voted already.
+1 anonymous

__anonymous__: Ok, thanks for being here ðŸ‘‹. And see you in the next one. It would be nice if a few more CC members could join us then.

## Miscellaneous Discussions

__cekickafa__: by the way, i tried to update docs, added GRIM wallet to grin.docs. Can you have a look at if possible. [https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/pulls](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/pulls)

__anonymous__: Sure, I will check it. Ignore the warning about he markdown links, there are some issues with that github plugin..

__cekickafa__: Ok, thank you. good to know it.
idk what is the use of this keybase, it has no privacy afaik. Maybe we switch something else for more participation and discussion.

__wayne__: I just wanted to pop in to see how things are going.
Hi!
Things seem to be ticking over okay
I really like the data provided by grincoin.org

__cekickafa__: so well for some agendas.

__wayne__: Has there ever been a discussion about creating a company around grin? Like how Bitcoin has Blockstream? Or is that a taboo topic? ðŸ˜‚
Ah I just see that Yeastplume posted in the forum, need to read!

__fredericcomba__: Bitcoin has Michael Saylor. Purchases Bitcoin and then uses it as collateral to purchase more Bitcoin! I can't find anything else (besides the amount of borrowers of Bitcoin) that explains the increase in price. There's also Tether (buys Bitcoin and then uses Bitcoin as collateral for USDT).

__wayne__: I'm more thinking about in way of creating products around grin that can bridge the gap between crypto and trad-fi. Like paying for devs and managers

__fredericcomba__: I'm building a survival network that provides an end-of-the-world lifestyle for those that help in making it happen. I'm looking for a crowd of one hundred backers, each one of them pledging 1000 (a thousand) GRIN every month to keep the project going.
The currency GRIN is decentralized, so let's have multiple initiatives as well.
Also, lending GRIN also creates demand for it (those that have borrowed it will have to purchase it to get their collateral back), increasing liquidity and the trade volume.

__cekickafa__: @waynegeorge It will become zcash. Bitcoin has company?
Blockstream is for profit.

__syntajax__: @cekickafa about keybase.

Would be sweet if we had an old school bbs we could telnet or ssh into. I could run an enigma-bbs on my home network and just port forward but I know yallâ€™d haxor me ðŸ˜†

__wiesche__: And what happens now without yeastplume? It's really difficult when I read all this.
Does it make sense to contact the old developers and make them an offer?

   **Meeting adjourned.**
