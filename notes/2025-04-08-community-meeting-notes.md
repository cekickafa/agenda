## 1. Open Discussion: Grin Project and Governance

__bobo123grin__: Have a nice evening

__anynomous__: I was held up. If anyone wants to discuss something grin or crypto related, I am here. The agenda for todays meetings is empty https://github.com/grincc/agenda/issues/166 So lets make it an open discussion for whatever is brought to the table.

__bobo123grin__: ðŸ‘‹

__cekickafa__: ðŸ‘‹

__bobo123grin__: Open discussion:first, I was a little disappointed that OC doesn't inactive anymore.now,I think it's good for governance, because OC has authority for grin project.

__anynomous__: We all have our chance to positively influence the project, through governance, through development, or various other activities. But for sure, it is a pity that OC and CC are more or less inactive.

__cekickafa__: So what is the plan for dormant status?

__anynomous__: I have no plan or solution regarding governance. I have no carrot, no stick, no authority over the actions of anyone else. I can only truly influence my own actions, so that is what I am doing now. If no one does development, I will do what I can. For governance, I will show up, I cannot speak for the other council members and they are not very responsive when tagging them, nothing I can do about that.

__bobo123grin__: People come to grin project and leave the project,it proves that grin is no permitted .less inactive is pitying,sure.

__anynomous__: In a way we can say it is truly, truly decentralised. Which means there is nothing any of us can do about what someone else is doing, or not doing. But it is not great. Doing things together is inspiring and motivating, doing things while feeling "alone", is a drain on motivation. I am afraid we just have to let it go, let grin die in peace for now People will become active when they decide to do so.



__bobo123grin__: So free mind for grin project,you can do what u want to grin project.

__anynomous__: Yes, complete freedom for everyone. Free to to let it die, free to give it sparks of life, free to use it, free to discard it, free to hoard it, even free to manipulate the price Complete decentralisation means complete freedom with all the ups and downs that come with it.

__bobo123grin__:
People will become active when grin coin price rises.

__anynomous__: Probably, yes. If not, that is also their freedom to chose so.

__cekickafa__: A project cannot be labeled as truly decentralized if its future direction and resource distribution almost dependent on the possible actions of a small, a few people group that holds all keys.I am confused about it.it looks like,more it is almost centralized and stalled at the development, governance, and funding control from outside view. Imagine for ex monero or bitcoin in same situation
>__anynomous__:  Yes, complete freedom for everyone. Free to to let it die, free to give it sparks of life, free to use it, free to discard it, free to hoard it, even free to manipulate the price Complete decentralisation means complete freedom with all the ups and downs that come with it.

__cekickafa__: how come it is free, decentralized, when it is manipulated?

__anynomous__: @cekickafa A project cannot be labeled as truly decentralized if its future direction and resource distribution almost dependent on the possible actions of a small, a few people group that holds all keys.I am confused about it. That is not really the case. Yes the keys are hold by a few, but the direction/governance can be done by anyone.Lets say a community member has a great idea for a project to be funded, he or she can 
1) set the agenda,
2) start a forum discussion. If good argumentation are given, it will for sure be discussed and implemented. For sure with the current inactivity it might take a bit longer to get the needed 4 votes and 4 signatures, but if there is something to actually discuss, people tend to show up and respond to messages

__bobo123grin__: Hi,anynomous,cekickafa.l see you in the forum and keybase you have been in grin community years ago, what is the impetus for you both still here,especially "most grin user free let it die"?

__cekickafa__: why monero or bitcoin not let it die but Grin ?I am scratching my head about your permissionless and decentralization views really.

__anynomous__: For me it is simple, grin is a nifty nimble project. The idea is as great (or small/minimal, depending how you look at it) as it was years ago. That does not change no matter how many, or few people are active whether the price of grin is 100$ or 0$. Those are just details. But for sure, I am enjoying being active less with the current "death phase" of grin. The more people chip in, the marrier.

__syntaxjak__: Grin is god

__anynomous__: 

>__cekickafa__: I am scratching my head about your permissionless and decentralization views really.

 It is just my opinion, I am trying to be as "zen" as possible about the current situation. Getting upset about it does not help, so best to just accept it for what it is

__bobo123grin__: Death phase is robust test for grin project, which is for decades designed

__anynomous__: @bobo123grin Death phase is robust test for grin project, which is for decades designed The current market cap is indeed rather remarkable, but I would not bet against grin on the long term. If I had more USDT, I would stock up, independent on whether the rest of the world thinks grin is a dead project or not.

__cekickafa__: For me, inactivity is vulnerability in all kind, since i am not a software expert but this is valid for blockchain i guess.

__anynomous__: I understand what you mean @cekickafa For me the current inactivity = waste. 
That is something I simply do not like, it is wasted of time to pause developement. So I accept that apparently the general opinion is that Grin needs to die, but that does not mean I have to "play dead" or become inactive, I will simply continue with development, even if it is just minor bug fixes and improvements

__cekickafa__: Grin++ most used wallet became doormant over a 1.5 year, many users again faced problems, imagine if GRIM wallet does not exist. What will happen if Grim dev takes a hike? No user autonomy here. You cant expect CLi wallet usage and call it fair launch, distributed coin for ex. So it looks like a few us talking worried about those things, but generally not people, it is very interesting. What do you mean general opinion is that Grin needs to die? Where did you get this impression?

__anynomous__: Well, grin has all it needs for basic use, but not for widespread adoption. It is fair, you can buy it, you can make transactions. I mean both grin-walllet, grin node, Grim, Grin++, they work, although some with minor issues. What I mean with that is that what I observe is that people are "letting grin die" as a projec. That is a choice, to become inactive. Either because some people think that is what the project needs, other do that simply because of the price, or because they see others become inactive. But not everyone for sure.

__syntaxjak__: Grin is code, grin is immortal. It is only peoples love for grin that can die.

__anynomous__: Only few people truly live like cypher punks. Perhaps because of Bitcoin and all the mooning, we just got a bit spoiled with there always being a large crowd.

__cekickafa__:

>__bobogrin123__:  Death phase is robust test for grin project, which is for decades designed.

in order to say that so you have a vision, able to see future tech and blockchain decades. How can you be so sure i wonder.

__anynomous__: Grin is not mooning, so only those who really care about it are around. That is not a big issue. But lack of development is an issue,

__cekickafa__: it is not mooning because it is core principles, decentralization, scalability is not in play. Reversed somehow.

__bobo123grin__: cekickafa in order to say that so you have a vision, able to see future tech and blockchain decades. How can you be so sure i wonder. Not sure,it is a positive opinion.I am not a software engineer or cyber expert.I do law work in china,mainland

__anonymous__: I believe there for sure will be a time again for good cypher punk projects like Grin, it is just not today, In the mean, just carry on, code on. Perhaps later on we will miss these quit times. I have to go now, nice chatting with you all ðŸ‘‹

__cekikckafa__: well i miss 2019 crowd times really. Things have changedThanks for all opinions and insights.anonymous,syntajax,bobo123grin, ardocrat ðŸ‘‹

__bobo123grin__: Bye bye,best wishes for all of you.
