## Community Updates and General Discussion

__any__: What a beautiful clean agenda again today.
From my side no updates this week. Despite me not doing anything for Grin at the moment, it keeps on ticking like a clock and it appears there is enough exiting things going on.
1) Michael added the MWixnet code (alpha) to the grin-wallet repository:

2) libsecp256k1 v0.6.0: MuSig2 Support & Other Improvements
keybase://chat/grincoin#cryptography/6164
Quite important developments for Grin long term.

__any__: @cekickafa How were your past two week, anything Grin going on or where you otherwise occupied like I was?
@cekickafa No worries, I know you have  connection issues with KeyBase.
Perhaps it is time to consider an alternative, although I do not know a more suitable platform right now.



## Grin Seed Signer Box and Bounty Discussion

__cekic__: A bit occupied. I made grin seedsigner box and waiting for a hero for seedsigner grin airgapped device software:)

Maybe we open a bounty for this? Multisig needed. How is your grintools goimg @anynomous ?

__any__: Due to holidays and my business being busy I did not get around to grin development lately. Hopefully this change soon.
A bounty for a grin seed signer sounds like an excellent idea. We can explore whether the community and other CC members support such a bounty.

## *TO DO List*

*  Explore the possibility of a bounty for a Grin Seed Signer software and discuss it with the community.
*  Community : Consider an alternative to Keybase for communication.

**Meeting adjourned.**
