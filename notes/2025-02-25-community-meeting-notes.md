## Funding grincoin.org, Groundskeeper voting.

__wayne__: Grincoin.org is great
I think it deserves funding
+1 cekic

__cekickafa__: yes, it filled the gap, works as external node also like grinnode.live with GRIM wallet.
It was voted in favor also. It will be funded.
+1 trab

__cekickafa__: Not enough CC members again, so not much to discuss for governance topics. Do you have anything to add @waynegeorge, @trab_grin ? About anything

__wayne__: Nothing in particular but happy to chat anything
+1 cekic

__cekickafa__: It would be good to discuss 'payment proofs'' also but..
Maybe add to next meeting topic.

__trabgrin__: Did we vote on the groundskeeper funding?

__wayne__: Is anyone long term missing?

__cekickafa__: you and @anynomous voted only.

__wayne__: Whatâ€™s new with payment proofs? I think I ask that recently

__cekickafa__: well, @tromp and @ardocrat emphasized it priority for implementing it. I know that all recently.
__wayne__: Is anyone long term missing?

__cekickafa__: @wayne from? what you mean. sorry
wayne: From CC
As only two votes for groundskeeper funding
I know some CC have always been quiet here

+1 cekickafa

__cekickafa__: well. We tagged. They are to respond. [https://forum.grin.mw/t/cekic-progress-and-request-for-2025-groundskeeper/11615/15](https://forum.grin.mw/t/cekic-progress-and-request-for-2025-groundskeeper/11615/15)

Well, that is obvious. Some silence about Grin is fact.

__wayne__: It seems that the community are in favour of dormancy which isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing. It gives everyone space whilst the industry figures out where itâ€™s going. At the moment itâ€™s moving in with trad-fi

__anonymous__: I will join in 10 min.

__cekickafa__: Trad-fi? You mean trading?

__wayne__: Traditional finance

__cekickafa__: ok,got it.Good to learn:)

__wayne__: Sorry. I hear people calling it that. With all of the ETF news and banks loading up on BTC, more regulation is heading cryptoâ€™s way

__cekickafa__: i think draconian regulations on the way to choke crypto in favor of onyl regulated stablecoins.Banks integrating with bitcoin only leads to centralization, less room for P2P. Where Grin fits in this space is unclear at the moment.

__wayne__: It depends on how bad it gets. It usually takes crisis for people to take action and want change

+1 cekic

__anonymous__: I see Grin as disconnected from that mostly
Only downside of stricter regulation is that it is harder to onboard grin.

__wayne__: So far in the UK at least, thereâ€™s a threat of tax increases with less social spending. Not looking good

__anonymous__: You mean tax on trading, or on earning with long term crypto investments?
A, you mean in general politics. Yaa, these are hard times. More military spending, less money for social, more resource constraints and inflation that keeps on being higher than we used to.

__wayne__: Just tax on earnings in general. They already donâ€™t move the tax thresholds each year which is a stealth tax increase

## Community relative  status

__anonymous__: You are right by the way about the community choosing to be kind of dormant. This is rather surprising while being in a bull run, or are we not in a bull run ðŸ¤”. I think it is a pity, just like choosing not to develop now is a pity, it is wasted time.

__wayne__: Thereâ€™s a lot going on with UK crypto tax laws. Many crypto exchanges donâ€™t support UK customers. I think they experiment and see what can get away with, then others follow. Thereâ€™s no ETF access for UK

__anonymous__: Ok, that is very surprising, since ETF's are the domain of traditional finance. I would expect them to try to move more people away from on chain crypto into ETF kind of stuff that basically only invest in without much using the blockchain.

__wayne__: @anonymous We are in a bull run but only for tolerated cryptos. Privacy coins still hold bitcoinâ€™s old criminal stigma.

__anonymous__: You are right about that, also for me at least this whole crypto bull run feels very artificial.
It is hard to explain exactly why, but it feels a bit fake, or maybe that is me just being disillusioned with crypto not being very cypherpunk anymore, but just a large scam money grab.

__cekickafa__: to @anonymous. you mean being doormant - Grin community or Grin as a whole or ?

__anonymous__: Well that is the hard part to get that I do not get fully myself. To me it felt like after the last Hard Fork, large part of developers and community kind of decided to step away from grin for god know how long. Like let it be dormant for 10 years, or maybe a 100 ðŸ˜›
A few other decided to keep it going, maybe at a slow pace, but going forward. Now it is very close to being in full hibernation mode, many developers not even responding to certain funding proposals, community also appears absent mostly. So around the bord it appears quite dormant.

__wayne__: Iâ€™d say grin as a whole. No active OC and now quiet CC

__anonymous__: Yep, so basically 80-90% of Grin is dormant right now. Now the question is why is that, and this a temporary thing or a long term thing. And I do not have the answer to that.

__cekickafa__: I agree.
Grin holds 6 million funds, whole mcap is 3.5 million usd. Kinda strange.
And dormant..

__anonymous__: Yes, so clearly, money is not the issue. I think this is a decision purposefully made by many, I mean to chose this dormant state, but I would not say for the general community, they are not that long term thinking. So perhaps from many of them it is just a reaction to the current sate of dormancy of grin, to just not be active on the forum for example.

__cekickafa__: Forum drags down the community maybe. Closed circle.AS this keybase, hard to participate from regular people most of them dont want to load this keybase crunky app.

__wayne__: Iâ€™m certain that grin will have a resurgence along with all other cypherpunk projects. Just a matter of time. Crypto doesnâ€™t need to be complicated but itâ€™s made so to allow manipulation and control.

__anonymous__: Or perhaps 80% of Grinners actually lost interest with grin, and we are just the lonely few who are grin maxi's who do not want to abondon the project. No, I am quite certain like you @waynegeorge that real crypto will have its own resurgence, perhaps separate from the artificial Solana meme coin bull runs, we will see.
Anyhow, it is a bit demotivating though. I understand yeastplume a bit better now. Working while others are not doing much or showing care, it makes it less of a rewarding experience.

__cekickafa__: Maybe, i remembered igno risk stuff. Recall a warning smthing similar to this

__anonymous__: I don't know that warning, I only joint just when he left the house.

__wayne__: I totally understand the demotivating feeling. As an open source project without a leader, I think itâ€™s done very well up to now. However the reality is that grin is a privacy coin and they arenâ€™t in demand. It is a gamble to work on something that may not take off so I guess thatâ€™s what puts people off.

__anonymous__: Perhaps. I never liked the classification of grin as privacy coin, I mean privacy is just a small part of what it acchieves. But I guess they did not have a minimalist elegant crypto basket to put Grin in as category. That would be a lonely basket ðŸ˜›
Anyhow, I will just do my little part in this project, hopefully fix one or two bugs, and be in governance to facilitate even if there is nothing to facilitate at the moment. Time will tell what will be in the cards for this little project.
Ok, I am off. Bye ðŸ‘‹

__waynegeorge__: Take care. Thanks for your work guys and for always showing up

__anonymous__: Same to you both ðŸ‘‹

+1 cekic, wayne

__cekickafa__: You too wayne. Thanks for the insights.

+1 wayne
