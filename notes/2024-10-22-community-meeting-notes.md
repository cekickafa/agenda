## Python Wallet Tool and SeedSigner Discussion

__any__: No agenda for today. So I will just give an update, anyone can chip in about what they are doing/Grin related or not.
I have had little time lately but still am working on my Python wallet tool when I can.
[Very much work in progress] [https://github.com/Anynomouss/grin-wallet-tool](https://github.com/Anynomouss/grin-wallet-tool)
Renzokuken has released a new version of mimblewimble-py with slatepack support ðŸš€ which will probably make my life in making that tool a lot easier.
I also have been pondering about the use of SeedSigners for Grin. They are cool, but them being offline might make things complex since the connected wallet would probably need to use rewind_hash functions (something similar to public keys only wallets in Bitcoin), to know the state and funds of the wallet. Also I was a bit disappointed with their price, basically they are as expensive to buy as Ledger or Trezor Hardware wallets that support a lot more coins.

How was your week @cekickafa?
I hope we can find some new meeting times that will allow other CC members to join our biweekly meetings to spice things up.
My time is nearly up, I have to go in 3 minutes
Ok, I am of ðŸ‘‹

__cekic__: Sorry  anynomous. Disconnected and Keybase crashes. I was away from comp 3 weeks.
That seedsigner DIY may lower the cost. I ordered parts separetly and assembled. Do we need better bulletproofs multisig for making grin custom seedsigner ? Hardware assemble part is more easy, firmware is the unknown.

## MWixnet Integration Update

__yeastplume__: I nearly have the mwixnet comsig code properly integrated into the master branch of the wallet. Just a few tests and bits of documentation then we should be ready for a new build including it
[https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-wallet/pull/726](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-wallet/pull/726)
and it will also be available in the json-rpc api
