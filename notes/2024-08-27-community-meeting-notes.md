## Grim Wallet Discussion

__any__: I do not think we need to discuss any formal topic, but we can discuss:
-Grim
-grin and grin-wallet updates
-grin docker updates
I only played little with the new Grim wallet, but I am impressed with what it all contains especially considering it is a first release. Multiple language support, multi wallet and account support
options to chose for local node (normal or archive), to recheck chain state, use remote grinnode.live node, o and of course dark mode for the interface which I like a lot üòõ

__cekic__: yes, i tried GRIM with linux, windows, android, it is solid kickass.Great.üíõ ardocrat

__any__: Exactly, it is really solid and multi platform support which so far only Grin++ offered.

## Grin Core and Wallet Update

__any__: Regarding the latest grin and grin-wallet update, very happy to see the self-spend in the contract branch.
To be honest I never got why this was not added in the last hard fork, but anyhow, better late than never

## Grin Docker 

__any__: I did a few weeks back some testing with grin on docker, it also was a very smooth experience.
Now there is a docker instance where you can run three nodes with three wallets for testing.
That is great, since it makes a good platform for testing mwixnet with the click of button.

__cekic__: thats cool

__any__: Very, and more importantly, it makes it possible for anyone to start playing and testing.

__cekic__: you tested on windows or linux?

__any__: All in all, quite a lot of good things are happening in Grin, and that while the CC... is basically passive right now, not really pushing for anything.
I tested on Windows, the docker containers are based on Debian and run very smooth, much easier than for example compiling grin or grin-wallet myself on Windows.
The experience on Linux should be exactly the same, that is the great thing about docker.

__cekic__: i will try it today.üëç Sounds easy:)

__any__: See here the repository and readme that explains the few commands that you need to run:

For me there is not much else to discuss. Anything you want to add @cekickafa?

__cekic__: Not really. Thank you.

## *TO DO List*

* Community: Continue testing and providing feedback on Grim Wallet, self-spend function on the contract branch, and the Grin Docker project.

**Meeting adjourned.**
