## CC Member Participation and Absence

__waynegoeroge__: A fair bit in the agenda today
__cekic__: Indeed, for a change ðŸ˜ƒ
it looks like so.

__Anynomous__: Unfortunately I just hear one of my kids crying, I have to go
+1 wayne,cekic

__waynegeorge__: take care

__anynomous__: I am still around on phone, but I cannot say much now ðŸ˜“

__waynegeorge__: I'm reading the agenda comments

__cekic__: Lack of participations from other members, follow up topics stayed more than months for the record.

__waynegeorge__: Is there anything further that needs discussing? I assume that there is private message channels between CC members. Is it fair to say that there 2 members are currently missing from everywhere?

__cekic__: it looks like more than 2 members. Only anoymous active.
Anyway. Take care wayneðŸ‘‹

__pirategrin__: ðŸ‘‹

__waynegeorge__: That's quite a worry. I hope that their absence is temporary

__anynomous__: Ok I am back.

__cekic__: Well, all code of conduct is written but hardly people obeys.

## Grin Addresses and Privacy Explained

__pirategrin__: So do address starting with grin work just like any other wallet addresses. Most videos I've watched say grin doesn't have addresses or amounts. Or are they outdated now?
Sorry I'm new and still trying to grasp everything

__anynomous__: Never mind, new issue came up. I guess this meeting was not meant to be for me.
+1 anynomous

__ingots__: ðŸ‘‹

__cekic__: to @pirategrin; Not outdated. No adress or no amounts visible on blockchain.

__anynomous__: A grin slatepack address is a public key and tor address. So it is only used to send data to over tor, and to encrypt packages with. Nothing on-chain.
So if you see an transaction or its outputs on chain, there is no way to know which wallet or slatepack addresses belonged to the sender or receiver.

__waynegeorge__: I remember that it took me a while to grasp the no address concept

## CC Funds and Governance Concerns

__waynegeorge__: Does the missing CC members issue mean that CC BTC funds are currently locked?

__ingots__: Multisig 4/7. How many members, how long absent?

__waynegeorge__: I think that the funds are secured by 4 of 6 multisig

I see that you @anynomous wrote that CC can sign in an emergency. Do you think that groundskeeper and grincoin.org funding is being rejected by other members then?

__anynomous__: No, I think they just do not see it enough as a priority, or they are ambivalent. Best to ask them.
It is bit like this, those who are still active in the CC do not want to spend too much time chasing non or less active CC members since that would increase our own burden even more.

__waynegeorge__: It's a difficult one. We shouldn't need to chase people to be interested. The question is, are there enough reliable community members if CC members want to leave? If not, then sadly it is what it is. If so, perhaps the CC needs a refresh.

__waynegeorge__: One thing that can get tiring for me as a community member is keeping up to date with conversations that occur on the forum. I gave up on Telegram a long time ago as it took up a lot of time for little reward. I watched a video recently about a lady who started a marketing business that used AI to capture key points from conversations and meetings and create meaningful content based on it. I thought about something like that for the forum, perhaps a plugin. Something that could provide summaries of things, create a timeline of events, etc.


**Meeting adjourned.**
